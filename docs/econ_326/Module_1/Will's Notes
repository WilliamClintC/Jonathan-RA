Things to ask Jonathan
    1. linear hypothesis does not work
    library car does not work
    
   1. When comparing tables, I was thinking just reprinting the tables so students don't need to scroll back to the top to look for it. But maybe thats spoonfeeding-- might confuse students even more
   
   2.There is a very bad argument. I may be dumb but I am sure the argumetn is not good.  not to mentionfinancial assets, stocks are not solely determined by stock holdings. Its not even clear if financial assets are a dummy variable or not    If we think about this, it makes sense: you can only have a "stock" if you have             financial assets! So, if I tell you what value "stock" takes on, you will immediately know        whether or not I have financial assets or not.
